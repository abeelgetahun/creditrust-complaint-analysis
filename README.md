creditrust-complaint-analysis
This project implements a chatbot for CrediTrust Financial, designed to help internal teams quickly extract insights from customer complaint narratives using a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) approach.

The chatbot allows users to ask natural-language questions about customer complaints across five key financial products and receive synthesized, evidence-based responses sourced from real complaint data.

Project Objective
CrediTrust Financial offers a range of digital financial products, including:

Credit Cards
Personal Loans
Buy Now, Pay Later (BNPL)
Savings Accounts
Money Transfers
With a growing user base and thousands of incoming complaints monthly, teams need a way to analyze unstructured feedback efficiently. This chatbot enables:

Semantic search on complaint narratives
Contextual answers from a large language model (LLM)
Filtering and comparison across multiple product categories
Features
Cleaned and preprocessed complaint dataset (CFPB)
Text chunking and embedding using sentence-transformers
Vector similarity search using FAISS or ChromaDB
Context-based answer generation with an LLM
Simple web interface for internal users
Evaluation metrics for response quality
